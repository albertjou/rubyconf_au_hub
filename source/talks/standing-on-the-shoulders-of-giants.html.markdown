We take for granted the wealth of knowledge and wisdom that goes into each library we use within our programs. Many of the them we use today are built on top of libraries that have existed much longer than most of us have been programming in Ruby.

Allow me to guide you through some of these unusual and mysterious libraries that are made available in every Ruby installation. I'm talking about the standard library, which has largely been apart of the Ruby ecosystem since before gems were available.

There's around ~70MB of code in every installation, and it's just waiting for those eager to explore and discover what the pioneers of Ruby have provided for us.
