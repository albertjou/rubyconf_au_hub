You may have this vague sense that you don't know Ruby as well as you think you do. And you worry that you're not learning and growing as a developer in your day job as much as you did when you first picked up Ruby. Perhaps you've lost that spark of excitement you experienced when you discovered new ways to solve problems with Ruby.

There is a way to re-invigorate your code and coding practices. Teach everything you know.

This talk will focus on some of the principals of teaching and why it can be an effective tool, not only for others to learn, but for you as the teacher to really deepen your knowledge of the subject. It will be specifically centred around using Ruby, and some of the ways I have discovered work well for teaching it as a first programming language.
