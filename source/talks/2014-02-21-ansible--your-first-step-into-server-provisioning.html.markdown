The ability to repeatably and automatically build your servers in code is essential for managing a modern Ruby application's server infrastructure.

Solutions such as Chef and Puppet are often used to solve this issue, but for some teams, this might be too costly to learn and implement effecitvely. Bridging the gap between these larger solutions and shell scripting is Ansible, a light footprint provisioning tool using SSH and YAML files to quickly define repeatable server creation and configuration steps.

This talk will cover:

introduce server provisioning at a high level
explain how Ansible fits into that pattern
describe simple Ansible commands and modules
run through a basic playbook example, bringing these elements together
summarise other functionality offered by Ansible
