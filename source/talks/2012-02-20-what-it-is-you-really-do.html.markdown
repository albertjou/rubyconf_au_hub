Programming is hard, correct? Code, tests, design patterns, abstractions, deployments, are the things we do everyday and coding can be a craft; it takes skill, patience, perseverance and sometimes downright stubbornness, but what is the result of all that hard work? What are we striving to achieve?

As programmers we often talk at length about how to build things. Questions like, what is the right level of abstraction? what database should I use? where should I deploy? etc etc. Indeed there is complexity in the craft of programming and in answering those questions. By why do we ask them in the first place?

You build software, you've put in all that hard work, and now you've launched.
Time to learn about what you really do for a living!
