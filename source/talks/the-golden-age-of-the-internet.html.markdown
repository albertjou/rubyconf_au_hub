Congratulations. The Internet is now the centre of civilisation as we know it, and we are the ones who shape the Internet. Our skills are in high demand, we are paid well, we find our work challenging, interesting, and even sometimes fulfilling. These are the glory days of our industry, and we should soak up every minute of it!

But with such great power comes a great deal of responsibility. Will we be looking back in the near future, wondering if we squandered our opportunities to shape the digital world accordingly?

There's no doubt that we value humanity, intelligence, and compassion. Let's take a look at the ways our industry can ensure these values are reflected not just in the people we are, but the way we work.
