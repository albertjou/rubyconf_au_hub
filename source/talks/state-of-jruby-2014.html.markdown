JRuby is a fast implementation of the Ruby language on the Java Virtual Machine.

You may wonder if it can be faster. You may have heard of the slow startup time. Can it load faster? You may have heard that your favorite C extension does not work on JRuby. What about cross-platform C extension API?

This talk will discuss these questions.

This year (2014), the project will release a major milestone: JRuby 9000 (ä»®). Main new features of this release include:

Ruby 2.1 compatibility
New compiler
Better InvokeDynamic experience
