So testingâ€¦ How does it work?
What is a unit test? Why is that an integration test, should I even bother with acceptance tests?

Let's work through the differences between the various types of testing, look at differing strategies for tackling problems and how they can be solved. Try doing things with TDD, try doing things building tests after.

Let's use RSpec, TestUnit and MiniSpec to test different techniques and perfect our tests. And we will look at how we can apply these to our real world problems to make our lives easier and our software better!
