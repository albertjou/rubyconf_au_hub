Learn to avoid the highs and lows of idea worship, and read your customers' minds for real cash dollars
You can build it. But will they come? More importantly… will they pay? Design and development skills are incredibly valuable in today's employment economy, obviously. But despite media "hacker" worship, those skills don't, alas, come packaged with a magical ability to know what real live customers will pay for.

The good news is: it's not a magical ability at all. You can learn it. And once you can read your customers' minds, you can design products that they'll need and want—with features they'll use—and marketing that they'll want to read and share. It's the best abstraction ever. This workshop will teach you how to spot the hidden, super valuable insights that are all around you.
