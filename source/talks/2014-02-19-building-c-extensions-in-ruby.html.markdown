You will learn how amazingly simple it is to build high-performance extensions that leverage existing C libraries.
You’ll receive a basic notion of the C language, and then you will dive into the various Ruby APIs that allow you to bridge C code to our favourite language.

We will also go through a heavy testing component that will help you ensure that your extension works as intended, and remains as bulletproof as possible.
