Take the next step in your coding journey!
Join us and continue the learning you started at Rails Girls. Since you have Ruby installed already, we can jump right in!

We've organised three mentor-led tutorials that will help you dive deeper into the world of professional development with Ruby. Tutorials include a look at some of Ruby's more advanced features and syntax, building a Sinatra app and deploying it, test-driven development and more.

Lastly, you will gain a greater appreciation of development work procedures by pairing up to solve coding challenges and using Git for version control.
