Ruby 2.1 is about to be released, it will include a generational GC,
performance improvements and a much improved platform for diagnostics
and profiling.

In this talk I will cover many of the new profiling and
instrumentation APIs introduced in Ruby 2.1, introduce you to the new
GC and show you some cool tools you can build on top of this. I will
cover memory profiling, GC instrumentation, the much improved stack
sampling, memory profilers, flame graphs and more.
