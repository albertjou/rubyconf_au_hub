So you want to be an open source contributor? Think you can handle supporting multiple rubies, tracking down weird bugs, stomaching all that the wider developer eco system can throw at you? Well good reader, I can tell you stories that will turn your stomach, and blind your eyes.

Let me take you on a journey deep into the depths of open source triage and follow the kind of madness that comes from tracking down bugs across differing versions of Ruby and VMs.

Finally let me entertain you with stories of the perils of dogfooding your testing framework, and throw in some stories about the kind of hackery you can commit with a bit of mischievousness.
