I'm an experienced web developer who loves working across the full stack - Everything from building out frontends (on iPhone / iOS and the Web), though to web application and systems development (Primarily with Ruby and Rails across a wide variety of technologies, but interested in Go, Python).

I've worked on everything from iPhone applications with millions of downloads, automating server management and provisioning across a wide variety of systems, real time data processing over large data sets and lots of problems in between.

I'm passionate about building products that help people and solving real world problems - whilst also doing so in a fashion that leads to good software development practices. Real world software that solves problems doesn't have to be a compromise with good software engineering.
