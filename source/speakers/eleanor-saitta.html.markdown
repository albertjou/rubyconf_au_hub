Eleanor Saitta is a hacker, designer, artist, writer, and barbarian.  She makes a living and a vocation of understanding how complex systems operate and redesigning them to work, or at least fail, better.  Her work is transdisciplinary, using everything from electronics, software, and paint to social rules and words as media with which to explore and shape our interactions with the world.  Her focuses include the seamless integration of technology into the lived experience, the humanity of objects and the built environment, and systemic resilience and conviviality.

Eleanor is Principal Security Engineer at the Open Internet Tools Project (OpenITP), directing the OpenITP Peer Review Board for open source software and working on adversary modeling.  She is also Technical Director at the International Modern Media Institute (IMMI), a member of the advisory boards at Geeks Without Bounds (GWoB) and the Calyx Institute, and works on occasion as a Senior Security Associate with Stach & Liu.  She is a founder of the Constitutional Analysis Support Team (CAST), previously co-founded the Seattle-based Public N3rd Area hacker space, and works on the Trike and Briar projects.

Eleanor is a regular speaker at conferences including the CCC Congress, SigInt, Uncivilization, ToorCon, Knutepunk, and Arse Elektronika. She is nomadic, living mostly in airports and occasionally in New York, London, Stockholm, and Berlin.
