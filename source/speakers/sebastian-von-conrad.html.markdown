Growing up in Sweden, Australia was about the last place Sebastian ever thought he'd visit, yet alone live. After 5 years and counting, however, he has no plans of leaving--at least not until he actually sees a snake.

Sebastian works as a Development Manager at Envato, where he most recently led the development effort behind Microlancer, Envato's latest product. He is a Railscamp organiser, helped out during the last RubyConf AU and is a founding member of Ruby Australia.

Sebastian also dislikes writing about himself in third person, but realises we must all make sacrifices for the greater good.
