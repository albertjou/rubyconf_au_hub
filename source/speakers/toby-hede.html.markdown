description: Toby Hede is a mild-mannered Software Engineer, based in Sydney, Australia. By day he works as Technical Lead for Ninefold, shaving yaks with Ruby & Chef and Redis and a zillion other awesome things. By night he pretty much does almost but not quite the same thing, occasionally using Go.

Toby's hobbies include collecting programming languages and databases, playing the drums, cutting code and pondering the nature of existence.
