description: My name is Seth Vargo. I graduated from Carnegie Mellon with a B.S. in Information Systems in 2013. I specialize in Ruby development, System Administration, Automation, Chef, Security, and Usability. I'm a big proponent of open-source and like to hack on projects in my spare time.

I aspire to become a college professor in the years to come, and I love teaching.
