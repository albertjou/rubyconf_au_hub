description: I am a mild-mannered Software Engineer, Developer & Polyglot Programmer, based in Sydney, Australia.

With nearly 15 years commercial software development experience, I have an extensive history building & leading teams to ship quality software, honed by a polyglot development background and years of experience spent in the trenches as a software engineer and team leader. I have experience across the software development life-cycle, and have worked for many years championing agile principles including XP, Scrum and Kanban. An accomplished and confident public speaker and evangelist, I am a regular speaker at meetups and conferences.

My hobbies include collecting programming languages and databases, playing the drums, cutting code and pondering the nature of existence.
