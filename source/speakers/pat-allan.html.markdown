Pat earns his keep as a freelance web and Ruby developer based in the coworking space of [Inspire9](http://inspire9.com) in Melbourne, Australia. Often, though, you'll find him travelling around the world, attending interesting events and meeting interesting people.

As well as working with talented development teams and writing [open source Ruby libraries](https://github.com/pat), he's a fan of bringing people together for gatherings small and large, including [Trampoline](http://trampolineday.com) and [Rails Camp](http://railscamps.com). And if you ask him nicely, he might even cook you a pancake.
