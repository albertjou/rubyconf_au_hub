Tinker. Sailor. Developer. Spy? Originally from a tiny cold island nation, Britain, Jon now lives in Sydney where he spends time sailing the high seas, plotting and working as a gun for hire, I mean freelance Ruby developer.

When not working on client work you can find Jon hacking on RSpec (as a core contributor), helping other open source projects and working on his own little side project(s).
