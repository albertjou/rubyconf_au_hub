Mark Bates is the founder and chief architect of the Boston, MA based consulting company, Meta42 Labs. Mark spends his days focusing on new application development and consulting for his clients. At night he writes books, raises kids, and occasionally he forms a band and “tries to make it”. In 2009 Mark’s first (surprisingly not his last!) book, “Distributed Programming with Ruby”, was published by Addison-Wesley. In 2012 Addison-Wesley published Mark’s second book, “Programming in CoffeeScript”.
